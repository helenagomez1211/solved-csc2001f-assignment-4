 <li>Output the number of tuples in each of your relations.</li>

 <li>Show all entries where the gender disagrees with the prefix (e.g. someone is “Mr” but their gender is “F”).</li>

 <li>List students from school “1000929”, giving first name and last name, in alphabetical order of last name.</li>

 <li>For each course, give course code and number of units. A unit is 6 credits (18 credits is 3 units, etc.)</li>

 <li>Give the names of all students whose citizenship status is “C” but who are missing their “examining authority”, “old ex auth” and “UCT score” data.</li>

 <li>Give the StuID of students who registered for both ZOO3 and ACCS1.</li>

 <li>Find the course and student in the database with the highest university result, along with that mark (i.e. that mark which is the largest university mark in the database).</li>

 <li>How many students have a mark (in any course) lower than some mark that student 1027 achieved?</li>

 <li>. How many result categories are there in the final symbols? (i.e.</li>

</ol>

<ol start="11">

 <li>. Give the average mark over all university results in all courses (i.e. a single value in the answer, the average mark for the university).</li>

 <li>. Find the mark range for each CS course (i.e. each result line/tuple has CS course name, lowest and highest mark obtained for that course).</li>

 <li>. Find the highest “UCT Score” obtained each year, but only for years where there were more than 10 students who matriculated that year.</li>

 <li>Which course(s) have the lowest number of fails (“F”) i.e. which courses have the fewest failures?</li>

 <li>. For each PSY2 student, show the number of senior Science courses they have passed.</li>

 <li>. Devise a useful query of your own involving the most interesting SQL usage you can think of. Explain clearly what it is meant to find out from the database, then show the SQL and its result, and then show/explain clearly how you know it is correct.</li>

 <li>. Delete all students who matriculated before the year 2000.</li>

 <li>Insert a new result for 1001, who also took ZOO1 but was absent from the exam.</li>

 <li>. The university has decided to use sum-of-6-best-matric-percentages as “UCT scores”, instead of the old system. Change all “UCT Scores” in the database accordingly by multiplying them by 10 and adding 30 (as a rough approximation).</li>
